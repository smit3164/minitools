Chinese Remainder Theorem Calculator: Accepts input for 
	x [congruent] a mod m
	y [congruent] b mod n
in the format of command line arguments --> ./crt a b m n
and outputs, c (modular inverse of m), d(modular inverse of n), and the solution, a common solution
mod mn.
	Known Bugs:

Prime Number Detector: Accepts input for any integer up to INT_MAX (+2147483647) and tells you if it is prime or
not.
	Known Bugs:
	Future update will expand functionality to include numbers greater than INT_MAX

More to come!
